Estimating phylum-specific matrices.  

## To-do  

First pass:  
- [ ] Prepare taxa lists for all phyla with >50 taxa  
- [ ] Prune reference tree for each phyla   
- [ ] Get branch lengths and total tree length  
- [ ] Run treeshrink on all phyla  
- [ ] ID phyla with shrunk trees  
- [ ] Get branch lengths and total tree lengths for pruned phyla   
- [ ] Identify resource usage vs. BIC across subsets of taxa in a big phyla
