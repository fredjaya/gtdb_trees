MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD TREE
-----------------------

Log-likelihood of the tree: -1890238.9951 (s.e. 18115.8926)
Unconstrained log-likelihood (without tree): -57014.2759
Number of free parameters (#branches + #model parameters): 12258
Akaike information criterion (AIC) score: 3804993.9902
Corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) score: 304346637.9902
Bayesian information criterion (BIC) score: 3892189.9107

**************************** WARNING ****************************
Number of parameters (K, model parameters and branch lengths): 12258
Sample size (n, alignment length): 9076

Given that K>=n, the parameter estimates might be inaccurate.
Thus, phylogenetic estimates should be interpreted with caution.

Ideally, it is desirable that n >> K. When selecting optimal models,
1. use AIC or BIC if n > 40K;
2. use AICc or BIC if 40K >= n > K;
3. be extremely cautious if n <= K

To improve the situation (3), consider the following options:
  1. Increase the sample size (n)
  2. Decrease the number of parameters (K) to be estimated. If
     possible:
     a. Remove the least important sequences from the alignment
     b. Specify some of the parameter values for the substitution
        model (e.g., the nucleotide or amino acid frequencies)
     c. Specify some of the parameter values for the rates-across-
        sites model (e.g., the shape parameter for the discrete
        Gamma distribution, the proportion of invariable sites, or
        the rates of change for different rate categories under
        the FreeRate model)

ALISIM COMMAND
--------------
To simulate an alignment of the same length as the original alignment, using the tree and model parameters estimated from this analysis, you can use the following command:

--alisim simulated_MSA -t Q.bac_locus_i3.treefile

To mimic the alignment used to produce this analysis, i.e. simulate an alignment of the same length as the original alignment, using the tree and model parameters estimated from this analysis *and* copying the same gap positions as the original alignment, you can use the following command:

iqtree -s <alignment.phy> --alisim mimicked_MSA

To simulate any number of alignments in either of the two commandlines above, use the --num-alignments options, for example mimic 100 alignments you would use the command line:

iqtree -s <alignment.phy> --alisim mimicked_MSA --num-alignments 100
