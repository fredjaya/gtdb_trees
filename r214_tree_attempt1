# An attempt to build a tree for R214

Here's the plan. 

## Starting tree

Try a few options. Use both the reduced and the full dataset, and the following software

1. fasttree2 (NJ step only)
2. rapidNJ
3. decentTree (if possible)
4. raxml-ng (parsimony tree)
5. TNT

Evaluate the likelihood of each of these 4 on the full dataset using an LG+G model in raxml-ng or fasttree2

## Online tree

1. Start with the r207 tree.
2. Drop all taxa *not* in the r214 dataset
3. Use IQ-TREE2 to add the new taxa by providing r207 as a constraint tree and r214 as the input data
4. As above but try the same with raxml-ng and/or other placement algorithms

Evaluate the likelihood of each of these 4 on the full dataset using an LG+G model in raxml-ng or fasttree2

## Model selection

Fit the following models to the best starting tree. Do it separately for the full and reduced datasets.

1. LG+G
2. LG+I+G
3. LG+R2-R? where ? is as long as we can wait


## Update starting tree

1. In fasttree 2
2. In raxml-ng
3. In IQ-TREE

In each case we use the best available model for the given alignmnt, with fixed parameters where possible.
