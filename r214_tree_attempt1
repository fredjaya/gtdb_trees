# An attempt to build a tree for R214

Here's the plan. 

## Starting tree

Try a few options. Use both the reduced and the full dataset, and the following software

1. fasttree2 (NJ step only)
2. rapidNJ
3. decentTree (if possible)
4. raxml-ng (parsimony tree)
5. TNT
6. FRACTAL

Evaluate the likelihood of each of these 4 on the full dataset using an LG+G model in raxml-ng or fasttree2

## Online tree

1. Start with the r207 tree.
2. Drop all taxa *not* in the r214 dataset
3. Place tips on r207 with a variety of algorithms:  
	- pplacer*
	- pplacer-SCAMPP*
	- APPLES-2
	- EPA-ng
	- IQ-TREE2
	- RAxML

Evaluate the likelihood of each of these on the full dataset using an LG+G model in raxml-ng or fasttree2. Methods denoted with a * should be used as it can be used to inform whether GTDB-tk can be improved. pplacer-SCAMPP can scale up to 200k taxa without sacrificing much accuracy. APPLES-2, EPA-ng are fast, but may not be as accurate as the pplacer methods.

## Model selection

Fit the following models to the best starting tree. Do it separately for the full and reduced datasets.

1. LG+G
2. LG+I+G
3. LG+R2-R? where ? is as long as we can wait


## Update starting tree

1. In fasttree 2
2. In raxml-ng
3. In IQ-TREE

In each case we use the best available model for the given alignment, with fixed parameters where possible.
