# 2306_nitrosponita  

Run a fast and complete pipeline for a decently sized phyla. Was going to choose Nitrosporita but it's a bit big. Chose Nitrospi**n**ota because it looks problematic (i.e. Nitrosponita and Nitrosponita_A).  

- [ ] Create taxa list with both Nitrosponita and Nitrosponita_A taxa  
- [ ] Calculate total tree length of r207 tree (place in `/phyla` and rename dir)
- [ ] Output distribution of branch lengths of r207 tree  
- [ ] Prune taxa from r207 tree  
- [ ] Get new tree and branch lengths
- [ ] Run treeshrink
- [ ] Get new tree and branch lengths
- [ ] Run unconstrained estimation on treeshrinked tree
- [ ] Output stats (expand later)

Bonus:
- [ ] Run estimation on pruned (pre-treeshrinked) tree
